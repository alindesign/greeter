Some days from now one of my friends who is also a programmer that will celebrate his birthday, so I was thinking why not make him a surprise :D 

After all these greeting tutorials (ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚), I've created a small app, that looks like a terminal (but doesn't feel like one ðŸ˜…) with the main 
functionality that will emulate a system that boots and run some commands.

### Disclaimer
This is a gift project write for fun in a couple of hours, nothing planned, just something that I wrote while drinking a glass of rosÃ© white (actually two ðŸ˜…)
