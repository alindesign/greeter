Some days from now one of my friends which is also a programmer, will celebrate his birthday, so I was thinking why not making him a surprise :D 

After all these greet tutorials (ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚), I've created a small app, that looks like a terminal (but doesn't feel like one ðŸ˜…) with main 
functionality that will emulate a system that boot and run some commands.
